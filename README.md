# 🧠 Machine Learning Projects — Beginner Tier

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository!  
This section contains **Beginner-level ML projects** that I built while learning the foundations of data analysis, model building, and exploratory data work.

Each project is organized into its own folder and includes Jupyter notebooks with code, visualizations, and insights.
